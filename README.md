# vgg19-cifar10-quantization
source code comes from Aaron Chen

What I wanna do is to reproduce the data quantization part in "Going Deeper with Embedded FPGA Platform for
Convolutional Neural Network"

Unfortunatelyï¼ŒI haven't finished.

The problems bothering me are :

1.What does 'A' denote in Equation 11 (I couldn't find the answer in this paper)

2.I have to learn how to convert those Equations into codes

  The most important thing is :
  
  How to use greedy algorithm to compare intermediate data layer by layer...
  
  
  
I'm distressed that I can't keep up with the course, so lots of time is spent on reviewing...

It's really really really not that I didn't take the study tasks arranged by Senior Bai seriously!!!
